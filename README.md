# odin-etch-a-sketch

In this project, I will be creating an etch-a-sketch type game, using
JavaScript to create divs that will be colored when hovered over.

Also, the user will be able to choose the size of the format, between
3 x 3 and 100 x 100. Really anything higher than 100 x 100, and it will
take far too long to load.

I plan to contain the whole "screen" within a div of a set size, instead
of it being full screen.

I will later try to implement a way to make it only work if the mouse button
is pressed and dragged around, but at the same time, you're not able to do
something like that on an ACTUAL etch-a-sketch, so probably not. Just for
fun though.
